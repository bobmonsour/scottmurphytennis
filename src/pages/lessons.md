Other than his occasional summer tennis camps in Italy, Scott offers lessons on several different courts in Marin County. And although he teaches in Marin County he’s available to work with anyone in the greater Bay Area and beyond. Juniors and Adults, novice or advanced, will improve their game through Scott’s instruction.

> I’m very passionate about both teaching and playing the sport of tennis. I believe in my ability to help anyone improve their game at any stage in their development. Players who truly have the desire to improve just need the right information and encouragement.

Don’t hesitate to contact Scott if you need help with your game. Scott also provides regular lessons for several individuals that travel through the area, and takes time to provide private lessons as he travels throughout the US and Europe. If you ask nicely, Scott may even string a racket or two for you.
