We all have those days when one or more of our strokes continually misfires. The frustration over this can build to the point where you’re ready to break the racquet over your knee or take up another sport and the frustration only compounds the difficulty you’re having. This is the time when you need to take a deep breath, relax and make what amount to slow motion swings. These are swings during which the end of the follow through occurs in conjunction with the ball actually landing on the other side of the court. To do this you really have to take it easy and in the case of groundstrokes you’ll have to promote good extension to make it work. The idea here is to relax and promote the proper feel for the stroke model. If this happens during a match just downshift a gear or two in terms of velocity until you get the feel back.
