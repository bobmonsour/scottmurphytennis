# 11ty-based website for scottmurphytennis.net

This site was initially built using Jekyll and was converted to use 11ty.

This site design is based on the theme called Menca (a Jekyll theme). I had to do some wrangling of the theme to get it to work with 11ty. But it works. The CSS is a bit heavy for the limited number of features that the site uses. Perhaps one day, I'll clean it up. But for now, it works.

Here's the site:

The site is hosted on Netlify.
